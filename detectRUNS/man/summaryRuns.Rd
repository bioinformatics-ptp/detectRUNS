\title{Summary statistics on detected runs}
\usage{
summaryRuns(runs, mapFile, genotypeFile, Class = 2, snpInRuns = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{runs}{R object (dataframe) with results on detected runs}

\item{mapFile}{Plink map file (for SNP position)}

\item{genotypeFile}{Plink ped file (for SNP position)}

\item{Class}{group of length (in Mbps) by class (default: 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-16, >16)}

\item{snpInRuns}{TRUE/FALSE (default): should the function \code{snpInsideRuns} be
called to compute the proportion of times each SNP falls inside a run in the
group/population?}
}
\value{
A list of dataframes containing the most relevant descriptives
statistics on detected runs. The list conveniently contains 9 dataframes that can
be used for further processing and visualization, or can be written out to text files:
1) summary_ROH_count_chr: n. of runs per chromosome and breed/group;
2) summary_ROH_percentage_chr: percent distribution of runs per chromosome in each breed/group (sum to 1)
3) summary_ROH_count: n. of runs per size-class (Mb) in each breed/group
4) summary_ROH_percentage: percent distribution of runs per size-class (Mb) in each breed/group (sum to 1)
5) summary_ROH_mean_chr: average size of runs (Mb) per chromosome and breed/group
6) summary_ROH_mean_class: average size of runs (Mb) per size-class (Mb) in each breed/group
7) result_Froh_genome_wide: genome-wide inbreeding ($F_{ROH}$) for each individual in the dataset
8) result_Froh_chromosome_wide inbreeding ($F_{ROH}$) for each individual (and chromosome) in the dataset
9) result_Froh_class: genome-wide inbreeding ($F_{ROH}$) for each individual in the dataset per size-class (Mb) of runs
}
\description{
This function processes the results from \code{slidingRUNS.run} and
\code{consecutiveRUNS.run} and produces a number of interesting descriptives
statistics on results.
}
\details{
\code{summaryRuns} calculates: i) the number of runs per chromosome and group/population;
ii) the percent distribution of runs per chromosome and group; iii) the number of
runs per size-class and group; iv) the percent distribution of runs per size-class
and group; v) the mean length of runs per chromosome and group; vi) the mean
length of runs per size-class and group; vii) individual inbreeding coefficient
estimated from ROH; viii) individual inbreeding coefficient estimated from ROH
per chromosome; ix) individual inbreeding coefficient estimated from ROH per
size-class
