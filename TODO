* Calculate the number of genotypes (SNPs) from map file in plot functions

* Calculate by chromosome (cut mapfile by chrom, then subset genotype)

* remove all subsetChillingham.* files
  - remove files from repository (bfg?)

* Deal with compressed data?

* Examples MUST be reduced (4.4Mb/5Mb is too much!)

* Try to index Runs (Cpp class) with hash
