* Fix filenames and positions: shuold be written or returned as dataframe?
  Ask for file removal / overwrite
  - no file is written

* genotype.raw need to be removed. Reads breed and animal name from input file (.raw)
  also plink.map is not useful

* Calculate the number of genotypes (SNPs) from map file.

* Calculate by chromosome (cut mapfile by chrom, then subset genotype)

* check that genotype columns and mapfile rows are indentical (6+number_or_rows)
  - done

* convert ped into 0/1 (ex AA->0, AG->1, two identical letters 0, otherwise 1)
  number. 11 21/12 22
  letter  AC CA/AC CC (ATCG)
  ABFormat AA AB/BA BB
  missing: '0 0' '5 5' 'N N'

* plotSnpsInRuns need to be fixed (genotype.raw and plink.map were removed)

* Does input file have always header? or not?
  - ped file doesn't have any header

* RUNs.run neet to work only with ped file positions, not raw
