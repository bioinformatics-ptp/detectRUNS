* Calculate the number of genotypes (SNPs) from map file in plot functions

* Calculate by chromosome (cut mapfile by chrom, then subset genotype)

* remove all subsetChillingham.* files
  - remove files from repository (bfg?)
  - replace with Kijas2016_Sheep_subset

* Fix notes:
  - Malformed Description field: should contain one or more complete sentences
    (ex. http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/what-constitutes-a-complete-sentence-td4709358.html -
    subject verb object)

* Cpp support

* Private functions
  - tests?

* Deal with compressed data?

* Examples MUST be reduced (4.4Mb/5Mb is too much!)
* After reducing the example files, create a Plink .hom file for the example of the readFromPlink() function

* Standardize column names across functions (limit renaming only to where it is necessary)
* Decide which functions to export (and remove the @export statement from all other functions)
* Revise documentation
* Revise Title and Description (subject, verb, object)
* Make Vignette (not too big --> leave material for the paper/extended documentation)
