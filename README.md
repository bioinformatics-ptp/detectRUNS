Detect Runs of Homozygosity (RoHom) and Runs of Heterozygosity (RoHet) in diploid genomes
=========================================================================================

This repository contains the source code for `detectRUNS` R package and its
`performance` tests. Here is the directory content:

```
├── detectRUNS
├── performance
├── README.md
└── TODO
```

`detectRUNS` implements two approaches:
- one sequential (e.g. Zanardi);
- one by overlapping sliding windows (à la Plink)
